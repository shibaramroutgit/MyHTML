        <hr>
        <p>Quality management is about making organisations perform for their stakeholders – from improving products, 
        services, systems and processes, to making sure that the whole organisation is fit and effective</p>
        <p>Managing quality means constantly pursuing excellence: making sure that what your organisation does is 
        fit for purpose, and not only stays that way, but keeps improving.</p>
        <p>There's a lot more to managing quality than just manufacturing widgets without any defects or getting 
        trains to run on time – although those things are certainly part of the picture.</p>
